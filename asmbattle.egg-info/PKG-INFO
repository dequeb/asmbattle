Description: # ASM battle
        
        This program is for me the old dream of creating a playing field to experiment with a simplified assembler environment that could be use to learn and to play. 
        
        ## The game
        Each player submits a program in the simplified assembler supported by the program. Each program is assembled, loaded in its own memory location and is assigned a virtual processor. Each memory location and each character written to screen at the end of the game counts for one point.
        
        A tiny BIOS provide a branch table for CPU startup and a print function (null terminated string). It's up to you to find where it is. (clue there is a "Hello World" program that uses it...)
        
        This is an early version. Enhancements will come based on user feedback.
